		<p>I've been a resident of this city for the majority of my life and a homeowner in District 18 for the last decade. I truly enjoy living here and I want my efforts as a Councillor to have a positive impact on the city. <a href="./contact.html">Please contact me</a> with any ideas you might have to improve the municipality.</p>

			<h2>Career</h2>
			<p>I began my career working with the Commissioner of Community Services and, after many excellent years, I resigned to pursue municipal politics. I've since had the pleasure of serving as the councillor for District 18 for over 8 years. I serve on both the Administrative Policies and Planning committees.</p>
